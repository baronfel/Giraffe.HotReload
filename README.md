# Giraffe.HotReload

A repo to explore using [FSharp.Compiler.Portacode](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Compiler.PortaCode) for hot-reloading Giraffe Views


#### Enabling Giraffe View Hot-Reload in your project

* Install the `giraffe-reload` global tool
  * `dotnet tool install -g Giraffe.HotReload.Cli`
* Invoke the `giraffe-reload` tool in watch-mode on your project
  * `giraffe-reload --watch --webhook:http://localhost:5000/update path/to/project.fsproj`
  * If your project runs on another IP or port, change it as appropriate.
  * The `/update` route is default right now, but can be [configured](#Settings)
  * You can run the tool from your project directory and it'll discover your fsproj as well.
* open the `Giraffe.HotReload` namespace and use the new `UseGiraffeWithHotReload` extension method on `IApplicationBuilder`. You'll likely want to `#if`def this around the `DEBUG` define, so that you don't allow hot-reloading in production.
* Use this extension method _instead_ of the normal `UseGiraffe` one. Check the sample project for an example usage.
* Launch your project as usual, likely via `dotnet run`
* Make edits to your giraffe handler


#### Enabling static content Hot-Reload in your project

* Give your webroot folder and all files a name in your fsproj and tell msbuild it will be watchable

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <WebRoot Include="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)/wwwroot/**/*" />
    <Watch Include="@(WebRoot)" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

* Tell msbuild to copy these files on builds in your fsproj

```xml
    <Content Include="@(WebRoot)">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </Content>
```

* Make an msbuild task for copying these files in your fsproj

```xml
  <Target Name="CopyWebroot">
      <Copy
          SourceFiles="@(WebRoot)"
          DestinationFiles="@(WebRoot->'$(OutDir)\wwwroot\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')"
      />
    </Target>
```

* Teach ASP.NET Core where your webroot is

```fsharp
  let webroot = "wwwroot"

  WebHostBuilder()
    (...omitted...)
      .UseWebRoot(webroot)
    (...omitted...)
```

* Start a `dotnet watch` task with this target. Everytime you save, msbuild will now copy this files to the output

```bash
$ dotnet watch msbuild /t:CopyWebroot
```

By default this will watch your webroot folder.  If you want to include additional folders, you can add them to `StaticFileProviders` in the [Settings](#Settings).

#### Settings

The current settings that can be configured are listed below.

```fsharp
  type Settings = {
    /// The route where the hot reload tool should post.
    UpdateRoute : string
    /// The route for the websocket that will refresh the browser.
    WebsocketRefreshRoute : string
    /// The name of the Giraffe HttpHandler member that will be searched for
    WebAppMemberName : string
    /// Static file providers for anything not under webroot
    StaticFileProviders : IFileProvider list
  }
    with
      static member Default = {
        UpdateRoute = "/update"
        WebsocketRefreshRoute = "/ws"
        WebAppMemberName = "webApp"
        StaticFileProviders = []
      }
```

You can pass these settings to the `UseGiraffeWithHotReload` as a second argument.

```fsharp
let settings = { Settings.Default with UpdateRoute = "/PleaseSendCodeHere" }

app.UseGiraffeWithHotReload(webApp,settings)
```


#### Triggering the auto-reload of your Giraffe app

The code looks for either a static HttpHandler value or a HttpHandler-generating-function called `webApp` (or another name that you provide in Settings) in your main application code.

If the value `webApp: HttpHandler` (or another name that you provide in Settings) is found, that value is passed into the HotReload middleware immediately.

If a member of the form `webApp: 'dep1 -> ... -> 'depN -> HttpHandler` (or another name that you provide in Settings) is found, the parameters are resolved from the `HttpContext.RequestServices` service locator on your behalf, passed into the function to get the `HttpHandler`, and then that value is passed into the HotReload middleware.

Log messages for both of these traversal paths will be written to the ASP.Net Core Logging Infrastructure under the `Giraffe.HotReload.LiveUpdate.HotReloadGiraffeMiddleware` logger name,

Check the `samples/ReloadSample/Program.fs` file for an example of a function-generating `webApp`.

WARNING: If your function includes generic parameters it _will not work_ at this time.

#### Enabling auto-refresh of your page

The new middleware exposes a websocket-friendly connection at `localhost:5000/ws`, and if you include a simple script like in your root page template every page in your app will support hot-refresh.
The important part is the `onmessage` handler, where the page is refreshed when a message is sent.

```js
var socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5000/ws');
socket.onopen = function(event) {
  console.log('Connection opened');
}
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log(event.data);
  window.location.reload();
  return false;
}
socket.onclose = function(event) {
  console.log("connection closed");
}
socket.onerror = function(error) {
  console.log("error", error);
}
```

## Running locally from the repo

To test the current set up:

* `cd` to the `samples/ReloadSample` directory
* run the `Giraffe.HotReload.Cli` project from that working directory to generate the project options
  * `dotnet run --project ../../src/Giraffe.HotReload.Cli/Giraffe.HotReload.Cli.fsproj -- --eval @out.args`
  * you may need to ensure that file exists first
* run the `Giraffe.HotReload.Cli` project from that working directory in watch mode
  * `dotnet run --project ../../src/Giraffe.HotReload.Cli/Giraffe.HotReload.Cli.fsproj -- --watch --webhook:http://localhost:5000/update @out.args`
* run the `ReloadSample` project
  * `dotnet run`
* make changes to the `ReloadSample` project

### Building


Make sure the following **requirements** are installed in your system:

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0 or higher
* [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) if you're on Linux or macOS.

```
> build.cmd // on windows
$ ./build.sh  // on unix
```

#### Environment Variables

* `CONFIGURATION` will set the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x#options) of the dotnet commands.  If not set it will default to Release.
  * `CONFIGURATION=Debug ./build.sh` will result in things like `dotnet build -c Debug`
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used to upload release notes and nuget packages to github.
  * Be sure to set this before releasing

### Watch Tests

The `WatchTests` target will use [dotnet-watch](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/dotnet-watch.md) to watch for changes in your lib or tests and re-run your tests on all `TargetFrameworks`

```
./build.sh WatchTests
```

### Releasing
* [Start a git repo with a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

```
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold"
git remote add origin origin https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git
git push -u origin master
```

* [Add your nuget API key to paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-config.html#Adding-a-NuGet-API-key)

```
paket config add-token "https://www.nuget.org" 4003d786-cc37-4004-bfdf-c4f3e8ef9b3a
```

* [Create a GitHub OAuth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
    * You can then set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to upload release notes and artifacts to github
    * Otherwise it will fallback to username/password


* Then update the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with a new version, date, and release notes [ReleaseNotesHelper](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-releasenoteshelper.html)

```
#### 0.2.0 - 2017-04-20
* FEATURE: Does cool stuff!
* BUGFIX: Fixes that silly oversight
```

* You can then use the `Release` target.  This will:
    * make a commit bumping the version:  `Bump version to 0.2.0` and add the release notes to the commit
    * publish the package to nuget
    * push a git tag

```
./build.sh Release
```


### Code formatting

To format code run the following target

```
./build.sh FormatCode
```

This uses [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) to do code formatting.  Please report code formatting bugs to that repository.
